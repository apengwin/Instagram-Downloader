## Installation Instructions

There are two ways about this.

### Option 1: Help me design an icon.
So I can publish this to the chrome extension store without this stupid jigsaw puzzle icon.

### Option 2 Clone the repo.
Either with git or by downloading a zip.

Go to `chrome://extensions`, and turn on developer mode. 

Click `Load unpacked extension` and select this repo.

Check `Enabled` if you haven't done so already.

Refresh.
